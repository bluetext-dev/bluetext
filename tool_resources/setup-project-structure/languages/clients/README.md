# Clients

This directory contains language-specific client implementations.

See `clients/README.md` in your project root for an overview of the client architecture.

## Structure

```
clients/
├── python/       # Python client implementations
├── typescript/   # TypeScript client implementations
└── README.md     # This file
```

Each language subdirectory is a library that can be imported by models in that language.
