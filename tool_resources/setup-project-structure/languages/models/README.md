# Models

This directory contains language-specific model implementations.

See `models/README.md` in your project root for an overview of the models architecture.

## Structure

```
models/
├── python/       # Python model implementations
├── typescript/   # TypeScript model implementations
└── README.md     # This file
```

Each language subdirectory is a library that can be imported by services in that language.
